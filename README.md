# hello-world
I'm a junior in High School. My dream colleges are as follows (from biggest dream and descending) - MIT, CalTech, UC Berkeley, and Georgia Tech. I'd like to major in Robotics, Quantum Phyics, Computer Science, or Network Security (I'd like to be a professional hacker more than anything else but the fam isn't okay with that as of right now). I'm into video games - I play CSGO, Warframe, Overwatch, and a bit of League. I'm an on-and-off Minecraft player (I get back in whenever my little brother bugs me to). I'm known to talk a lot more than I need to. For proof, see above.
